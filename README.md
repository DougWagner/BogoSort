# BogoSort
One of the world's worst sorting algorithms.

This is the bogosort. Don't use it in anything because it is terrible.
If you are impossibly lucky, the algorithm will sort an array of integers in one pass.
If you are like the rest of the world, be prepared to be sitting at your computer for a while.

This algorithm takes an array of integers, checks if it is sorted, and if it isn't, it shuffles the array and tries again.
Sorting an array of 10 integers has taken anywhere from between .8 seconds, to 200 seconds.

Have fun.
